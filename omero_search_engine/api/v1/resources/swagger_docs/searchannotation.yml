 API endpoint to search the annotation (key/value pair) for a resource (e.g. image, project, study)
 The request contations a dict (query) which has the following format:
 {'query_details':{"and_filters":and_filters,"or_filters":or_filters}}
 each of and_filters and or_filters is a list of dicts whihc contains the search conditions, an example of and_filters is:
 and_filters=[{"Organism" : "Homo sapiens", "operator": "equals"},{"Gene Symbol": "NCAPD2", "operator": "equals"},{ "Cell Cycle Phase" :"anaphase", "operator": "equals"}]
 This means returns all images which each has (Organism" = "Homo sapiens" and "Gene Symbol"= "NCAPD2" and "Cell Cycle Phase" ="anaphase")
 or_filters means that the results should satisfy at least one condition inside the or_filters list

 Example:
   {
     "query_details": {
         "and_filters": [
           {
             "name": "Gene Symbol",
             "value": "pdx1",
             "operator": "equals"
           }
         ],
         "or_filters": [

         ],
         "case_sensitive": false
       }
       }
