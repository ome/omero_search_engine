A searchengine endpoint to accept complex query
API endpoint to search the annotation (key/value pair), the main difference between this endpoint and searchannotation is this one can be used to search different resources and return the images which satisfy the search conditions.
The query data has a similar format to the query for searchannotation.
Example:
   {
     "query_details": {
       "and_filters": [
         {
           "name": "Cell Line",
           "value": "hela",
           "operator": "equals",
           "resource": "image"
         },
         {
           "name": "Name (IDR number)",
           "value": "idr0008-rohn-actinome/screenB",
           "operator": "equals",
           "resource": "project"
         }
       ],
       "or_filters": [

       ],
       "case_sensitive": false
     }
    }


The maximum number of returned results is 1000, so if the number of results is bigger than that, a bookmark should be added to the query to call the next page. bookmark is retuned with each page of results and should be used to call the next page.
Example of uing bookmark:

  {
     "resource":"image",
     "query_details":{
        "and_filters":[
           {
              "name":"Cell Line",
              "operator":"equals",
              "query_type":"keyvalue",
              "resource":"image",
              "value":"hela"
           }
        ],
        "case_sensitive":false,
        "or_filters":[

        ]
     },
     "bookmark":
  [107448]
